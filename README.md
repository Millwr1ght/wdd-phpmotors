# wdd-phpmotors
a website about cars built with PHP; classwork for CSE 340 - Backend Development

only uploaded to github because I was travelling by train to visit family during W02 I wouldn't be able tp bring my PC on the train to finish the assignment. Figured out a different workaround

## how to play
1. move or copy /phpmotors to ~/xampp/htdocs
2. open xampp, start server, go to localhost/phpmotors
