# wdd-phpmotors
a website about cars built with PHP; classwork for CSE 340 - Backend Development

only uploaded to github because I was travelling by train to visit family during W02 I wouldn't be able tp bring my PC on the train to finish the assignment. Figured out a different workaround

## how to play
1. move or copy /phpmotors to ~/xampp/htdocs
2. open xampp, start php server
3. open phpmyadmin or your xampp database/sql admin
4. import the phpmotors/sql/phpmotors.sql database
5. set up the database user account using credentials found in /library/connections.php
6. go to localhost/phpmotors to see site
